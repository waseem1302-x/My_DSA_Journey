# ðŸ“˜ Week 1 DSA Notes â€” Arrays (Binary Search + Two Pointers)

---

## ðŸ”¹ 1. Problem-Solving Mindset

Whenever face a problem:

1. **Understand the problem** â€“ restate in your own words.
2. **Think brute force** â€“ how would I solve it slowly (nested loops)?
3. **Dry run** â€“ test small input on paper.
4. **Optimize** â€“ Can I use sorted property? Can I avoid nested loop?
5. **Code** â€“ Write clean, structured solution.
6. **Check edge cases** â€“ empty array, single element, duplicates, large inputs.

## ðŸ”¹ 2. Binary Search â€” Core Pattern

* **When to use?** Sorted arrays or monotonic condition.
* **Goal?** Cut search space in half each step.
* **Key Loop Condition:** `while left <= right`

### Pattern Code

```python
left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
while left <= right:
    mid = (left + right) // 2
    
    if nums[mid] == target:
        return mid
    elif nums[mid] < target:
        left = mid + 1
    else:
        right = mid - 1
```

### Important Points:

* Use `<=`, not `<`, else last element may be skipped.
* `mid = (left + right) // 2` (Python handles overflow).
* Edge case: return `left` if inserting position.

### Problems Learned:

* **35. Search Insert Position** â†’ insert location if not found.
* **704. Binary Search** â†’ standard template.
* **278. First Bad Version** â†’ use binary search on a boolean condition.
* **69. Sqrt(x)** â†’ binary search on answer.
* **34. Find First & Last Position** â†’ binary search variant to find boundaries.
* **33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array** â†’ tricky conditions, check which half is sorted.

## ðŸ”¹ 3. Two Pointers â€” Core Pattern

* **When to use?** Sorted arrays, reversing, palindromes, partitioning.
* **Goal?** Reduce complexity from O(nÂ²) â†’ O(n).
* **Key Loop Condition:** `while left < right`

### Pattern Code

```python
left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
while left < right:
    if condition:
        left += 1
    else:
        right -= 1
```

### Important Points:

* Always check duplicates (skip them when needed).
* Careful with string reversal or palindrome check.
* Move pointers based on problem logic:

  * **Shrink window** â†’ palindrome check.
  * **Expand/Shrink** â†’ container water, two sum.

### Problems Learned:

* **167. Two Sum II** â†’ move left/right depending on sum.
* **977. Squares of a Sorted Array** â†’ compare absolute values.
* **344. Reverse String** â†’ swap characters until middle.
* **125. Valid Palindrome** â†’ ignore non-alphanumeric, compare left/right.
* **283. Move Zeroes** â†’ in-place shift using slow/fast pointers.
* **11. Container With Most Water** â†’ always move pointer with smaller height.

## ðŸ”¹ 4. Brute Force â†’ Optimized Thinking

* **Brute Force:**

  * Try every possibility (nested loop).
  * Good for clarity but bad for large inputs.
* **Dry Run:**

  * Write 1â€“2 examples.
  * Track pointer movements step by step.
* **Optimized:**

  * Ask: "Do I really need nested loops?"
  * Use sorted property, binary search, or two pointers.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 5. Edge Cases to Always Test

* Empty array: `[]`
* Single element: `[1]`
* Target not found: `[1,3,5], target=2`
* All duplicates: `[2,2,2,2]`
* Negative numbers included.

## ðŸ”¹ 7. Quick Practice Tasks

* Re-implement Binary Search **without looking**.
* Dry run `nums = [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]` (rotated array) for target = 3.
* Code palindrome check from scratch.
* Move Zeroes: test `[0,1,0,3,12]`.
