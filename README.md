# 🧠 LeetCode + DSA Practice in Python

Hi, I'm Waseem Mushtaq 👋  
This repo contains my daily practice of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using Python, with problems mainly from **LeetCode**, categorized by topic.

My goal is to build a strong foundation and prepare for top tech interviews (MAANG, remote jobs, internships).
