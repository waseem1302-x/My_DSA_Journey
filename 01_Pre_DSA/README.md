# 🏋️ Pre DSA Practice

## 📌 Overview
This **01_Pre_DSA** folder is a dedicated preparation space **before starting my full Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) journey**.  
Instead of jumping straight into DSA topics like arrays, linked lists, and algorithms, the idea is to **strengthen Python fundamentals, logical thinking, and problem-solving** first.

Think of this as **my warm-up workout before the DSA marathon** 🏃‍♂️💨.

---

## 🎯 Purpose
- **Sharpen Python skills** so I can focus on logic, not syntax, during DSA.
- Build **confidence** by solving small, clear problems before tackling complex ones.
- Improve **problem decomposition** — breaking big problems into smaller steps.
- Get into the habit of **writing clean, modular, and testable code**.
- Understand **basic time and space complexity** naturally through practice.

---

## 🧠 Why This is Important Before DSA
DSA requires:
- Strong grip on **variables, loops, conditions, and functions**.
- Comfort with **Python data structures** (lists, dicts, sets, strings).
- Ability to **trace and debug code quickly**.
- Problem-solving patterns awareness.

If these skills are weak, DSA can feel overwhelming and frustrating.  
This folder ensures I **enter DSA fully prepared** and confident.

## 📌 Problem Categories

### 1️⃣ **Simple Logic Problems**
- Focus: loops, conditions, and basic number logic.
- Examples: FizzBuzz, Palindrome check, Fibonacci, Factorial, Prime check.

### 2️⃣ **List & String Problems**
- Focus: array/list indexing, string manipulation, sorting basics.
- Examples: Reverse strings/lists, find max/min, count vowels, merge lists.

### 3️⃣ **Dictionary & Set Practice**
- Focus: key-value lookups, set operations, frequency counting.
- Examples: Word frequency counter, non-repeating character, set union/intersection.

### 4️⃣ **Loop & Condition Challenges**

## 🚀 How This Will Help in DSA
- **Fluent Python Syntax** → No wasted time remembering commands.
- **Improved Debugging** → Can fix logical bugs faster.
- **Pattern Recognition** → Start identifying problem types early.
- **Stronger Logic** → Transition into DSA with a problem-solver mindset.
- **Confidence Boost** → Begin Arrays and Algorithms without fear.

---

## 📅 Plan
1. Solve **all problems** category by category.
2. For each problem:
   - Write the solution from scratch.
   - Dry run the code with test cases.
   - Think about **time complexity** (Big O).
3. Push progress to GitHub daily.

## 💡 Final Note
> *"Solve 100 problems deeply, not 1000 shallowly."*  
> This `01_Pre_DSA` is the foundation. Once it’s solid, DSA will not feel like a mountain — it’ll feel like the next exciting climb.  
> InshaAllah, this preparation will make the DSA journey smooth, structured, and successful.
